# Week 1 Exercises: Introduction to Linux and Shell Usage

The maximum score on this assignment is 100 points, but the exercises provide opportunities to score up to 110 points. Extra points will not count toward the next assignment. 
This assignment will be graded based on the correct output files. Incorrectly following the instructions, including naming errors and not following the instructions in order will all result in a loss of points. If you are in doubt, delete the directory and start the exercise over. 

## General Instructions:
Complete the following exercises in the virtual machine (VM). 

1. Connect via `ssh` to the VM:
   ```bash
   ssh <user>@<hostname>
   ```

You should be in your home directory. Confirm with `pwd`. You can also access your home directory via the shortcut `~/`. 

2. Create a directory named `linux_and_scripting` in your home directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir ~/linux_and_scripting
   ```

3. Inside `linux_and_scripting`, create a subdirectory named `week1_basics`:
   ```bash
   mkdir ~/linux_and_scripting/week1_basics
   ```

   ```

4. Display the contents of `hello.txt` with `cat`:
   ```bash
   cat hello.txt
   ```

5. Run `ls` to list files in the directory.

6. Create a directory named `test_dir` within `week1_basics`:
   ```bash
   mkdir test_dir
   ```

7. Inside `test_dir`, create files `test1.txt`, `test2.txt`, and `test3.txt` using `touch`:
   ```bash
   touch test1.txt test2.txt test3.txt
   ```

8. Return to `week1_basics` and use `tree` to display the directory structure:
   ```bash

## Exercise 4: Exploring Help Utilities and `man` Pages

### Objectives:
Learn how to use `man` pages and help utilities to explore commands and their options.

### Steps:
1. Use `man ls` to explore options:
   ```bash
   man ls
   ```

2. Document three `ls` options in a file:
   ```bash
   echo "-a: Show all files, including hidden files." > ex04_ls_options.txt
   echo "-l: List files in long format." >> ex04_ls_options.txt
   echo "-R: List directories recursively." >> ex04_ls_options.txt
   ```

3. Use `man rm` to explore options and document two of them:
   ```bash
   echo "-i: Prompt before removing each file." > ex04_rm_options.txt
   echo "-r: Remove directories and their contents recursively." >> ex04_rm_options.txt
   ```

4. Use `apropos directory` to find two commands related to directories and document them:
   ```bash
   apropos directory > ex04_directory_commands.txt
   ```

5. Write an explanation of the difference between `man`, `apropos`, and `whatis` in a file:
   ```bash
   echo "'man': Displays the manual for a command." > ex04_apropos_vs_whatis.txt
   echo "'apropos': Searches the manual pages for a keyword." >> ex04_apropos_vs_whatis.txt
   echo "'whatis': Gives a short description of a command." >> ex04_apropos_vs_whatis.txt
   ```

### Output:
Ensure all files are saved with correct permissions:
```bash
chmod 644 ex04_ls_options.txt
chmod 644 ex04_rm_options.txt
chmod 644 ex04_directory_commands.txt
chmod 644 ex04_apropos_vs_whatis.txt
```

## Exercise 5: Using `grep`

### Objectives:
Learn to search for text within files using `grep`.

### Steps:
1. Create a file named `log.txt` with multiple entries:
   ```bash
   echo "This is a log entry" > log.txt
   echo "Another entry in the log" >> log.txt
   echo "This line does not contain the keyword" >> log.txt
   ```

2. Find lines containing "entry" and save to a file:
   ```bash
   grep "entry" log.txt > ex05_grep_output.txt
   ```

3. Find lines containing "log" and append to the file:
   ```bash
   grep "log" log.txt >> ex05_grep_output.txt
   ```

4. Find lines that do not contain "entry" and append to the file:
   ```bash
   grep -v "entry" log.txt >> ex05_grep_output.txt
   ```

### Output:
Ensure the output file is saved with the correct permissions:
```bash
chmod 644 ex05_grep_output.txt
```

### Objectives:
Practice using the `*` wildcard with `ls` and `cp`.

### Steps:
1. Navigate to `week1_basics` and create a folder named `wildcard_test`:
   ```bash
   mkdir wildcard_test
   ```

2. Inside `wildcard_test`, create the files `card1.txt`, `card2.txt`, and `card3.txt`, as well as `wild1.log` and `wild2.log`:
   ```bash
   touch card1.txt card2.txt card3.txt wild1.log wild2.log
   ```

3. Run `ls *.txt` in `wildcard_test` to display all `.txt` files:
   ```bash
   ls *.txt
   ```

4. Run `ls card*.txt` to display files starting with "card":
   ```bash
   ls card*.txt
   ```

5. Create a subdirectory named `backup` in `wildcard_test`:
   ```bash
   mkdir backup
   ```

6. Use `cp` with the `*` wildcard to copy all files with "2" in their name to `backup`:
   ```bash
   cp *2* backup/
   ```

7. Save the structure of `wildcard_test`:
   ```bash
   tree wildcard_test > ex06_wildcard_output.txt
   chmod 644 ex06_wildcard_output.txt
   ```

## Exercise 7: Using Special Characters and Quotes with `echo`

### Objectives:
Practice using special characters (`*`, `$`, `\`) and single/double quotes with `echo`.

### Steps:
1. Create a file called `ex07_quotes_test.txt` in `week1_basics`:
   ```bash
   touch ex07_quotes_test.txt
   ```

2. Create an environment variable called `FILE` and set it to a file name:
   ```bash
   FILE="file1.txt"
   ```

3. Print the variable to the screen:
   ```bash
   echo $FILE
   ```

4. Run the following `echo` commands:
   - Without quotes:
     ```bash
     echo This is a test without quotes * >> ex07_quotes_test.txt
     ```
   - With double quotes:
     ```bash
     echo "This is a test with quotes *" >> ex07_quotes_test.txt
     ```
   - Escaping characters:
     ```bash
     echo This is a test with escaped \* >> ex07_quotes_test.txt
     ```
   - Escaping `$` in variable names:
     ```bash
     echo "Escaping \$FILE in text" >> ex07_quotes_test.txt
     ```

### Output:
Ensure `ex07_quotes_test.txt` is saved with correct permissions:
```bash
chmod 644 ex07_quotes_test.txt
```

## Exercise 8: SSH and `scp` for Remote Access

### Objectives:
Practice connecting to a remote machine using `ssh` and transferring files with `scp`.

### Steps:
1. Navigate back to your home directory.
   
2. Create a directory named `remote_test` in your home directory.

3. Print the name of the machine using `hostname`:
   ```bash
   hostname
   ```

4. Inside `remote_test`, create a file called `remote_file.txt` and save the hostname to the file:
   ```bash
   echo $(hostname) > remote_test/remote_file.txt
   ```

5. Disconnect from the VM:
   ```bash
   exit
   ```

6. On your own machine's terminal or powershell use the `scp` command to copy `remote_file.txt` to your `Downloads` folder as `ex08_remote_access_output.txt`:
   ```bash
   scp <user>@<hostname>:"~/remote_test/remote_file.txt" "<path-to-your-Downloads-folder>/ex08_remote_access_output.txt"
   ```
   
   Windows NOTE: If `scp` does not work on your powershell, please install OpenSSH on your machine with the following command: 
   ```
    Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name OpenSSH.Client~~~~0.0.1.0
   ```

   
7. Still on your local machine, use scp to copy the file back to the VM into the `week1_basics` directory.
   ```bash
   scp "<path-to-your-Downloads-folder>/ex08_remote_access_output.txt" <user>@<hostname>:"~/linux_and_scripting/week1_basics/"
   ```

### Output:
Ensure `ex08_remote_access_output.txt` is saved with correct permissions:
```bash
chmod 644 ex08_remote_access_output.txt
```
