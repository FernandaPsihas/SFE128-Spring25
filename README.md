## Tips on connecting via ssh into the virtual machine (VM)

Use the following command: 
```
ssh <username>@sfe128-vm2.eng.franciscan.edu
```
- If `vm2` does not work for you, try `vm1`
- Ensure that you are on the BaronNet network
- Your username and password for the VM might be different than your usual credentials, make sure that you are using the ones given to you via email.
- If on a Windows machine, use powershell to connect.
- Please note that you will be prompted to change your password. You will enter your old password a total of 2 times and your new password a total of 2 times.
